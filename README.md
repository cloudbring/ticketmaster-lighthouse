# ticketmaster-lighthouse

This is a provider for [ticketmaster](http://ticketrb.com). It provides interoperability with (Lighthouse)[http://www.lighthouseapp.com/] through the ticketmaster gem.

## Requirements

* rubygems (obviously)
* lighthouse-api gem (version 1.10 or larger preferred)
* jeweler (only if you want to repackage and develop)

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
